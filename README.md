# Aruco Marker Robot Arm
Using a 3d printed and servo powered robot arm we will be able to use a camera and aruco markers to detect objects, pick them up and move them! 
 
## Status ðŸŸ  - In Progress
------------------
*   I am currently waiting for a raspberry pi in the mail along with a camera and I'm still 3d pringting parts.
I have over 30 parts to print which will take up to 35 hours of print time.

*   I am currently programming some scripts and modules that will control the servos, from the camera input.
